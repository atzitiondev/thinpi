## This is Documentation on FreeRDP and out customized version of it (tprdp)

The official Documentation was very confusing and hard to understand so I am going to write up everything i can to make it easier to understand.

This is in no way perfect or the official Documentation of the project

## tprdp command line args

- /v:1.1.1.1 
-- This will be the server IP you are trying to connect to 

- /u:username
-- This will automatically use that user on sign in 

- /p:password
-- same as above it will auto use this password but will also auto sign in the user
